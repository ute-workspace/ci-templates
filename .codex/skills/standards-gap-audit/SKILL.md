name: standards-gap-audit
description: Analyze the result of an agent run (typically another skill's Agent Run Report) to classify why it was incomplete, guessed, or unclear — project doc gap, weak skill, missing standard, missing archetype, CI/CD boundary confusion, or not a standards gap at all. Use when a skill's output is unclear or its Agent Run Report lists non-trivial gaps/assumptions, not as a routine pipeline step.

# Standards Gap Audit

> Canonical portable skill (agent-neutral). Adapter copies: `adapters/claude/.claude/skills/standards-gap-audit/SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex/skills/standards-gap-audit/SKILL.md` — keep in sync with this file. See `docs/portable-skills.md`.

Canonical procedure: `.agents/core/sdlc/standards-gap-audit.md`. Read it before
running this skill — this file only adds the Claude-specific wrapper.

## Goal

Turn a confusing, thin, or gap-riddled agent run into a short, classified
list of what's actually wrong: the live project, its missing documentation,
a weak skill, a missing standard, a missing archetype, a CI/CD boundary
mistake, or nothing this repo owns at all. Exists so gaps get fixed at the
right layer instead of being silently re-guessed on every run — see
`docs/evaluation-loop.md`.

## Inputs

The Agent Run Report(s) from the run(s) being audited (or the raw output if
no report exists), the skill outputs themselves, the project's own
`docs/*.md`, and the relevant `.agents/core/standards/`, `.agents/core/sdlc/`,
`.agents/core/archetypes/`, and `skills/` files. Full list:
`.agents/core/sdlc/standards-gap-audit.md`.

## Process

1. Read `.agents/core/sdlc/standards-gap-audit.md` in full.
2. Pull every "Missing input", "Assumption made", "Project documentation
   gap", and "standards gap" line out of the Agent Run Report(s) under
   audit.
3. Classify each item against the gap types below — check the file a gap
   type points at before writing the finding; don't guess whether it
   already covers the case.
4. Separate anything that isn't a standards gap: it belongs to the project
   itself, or to a different repository (CI/CD template repo,
   deployment/infra repo — see `.agents/core/standards/ci-cd.md`).
5. Do not edit `skills/`, `.agents/core/`, or `.agents/core/archetypes/` as part of this
   audit unless explicitly asked to apply a fix afterward.

## Gap types

- `project-doc-gap` — the project's own docs don't cover it; standards gave
  enough guidance to know what was missing. Fix: the project's `docs/`.
- `agent-skill-gap` — a skill's process/outputs are ambiguous or
  incomplete. Fix: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- `core-standard-gap` — a policy question `.agents/core/standards/` should answer
  doesn't, or is ambiguous. Fix: `.agents/core/standards/<name>.md`.
- `archetype-gap` — no archetype matches the stack, or an existing one is
  wrong/incomplete. Fix: `.agents/core/archetypes/<type>/`.
- `ci-cd-boundary-gap` — confusion about pipeline ownership vs.
  `ci-templates`/`jenkins-library`/`ansible`/`automation`/
  `infra`/`gitops`. Fix: `.agents/core/standards/ci-cd.md`.
- `vendor-skill-gap` — a third-party skill/pattern would close it and is
  worth reviewing for import. Fix: `docs/vendor-skill-mapping.md`,
  `vendor-skills/`.
- `not-agent-standards` — belongs to the project or a different repository
  repository entirely. No fix here — note only.

## Required outputs

```md
## Standards Gap Audit

| Area | Problem | Evidence | Gap type | Fix target | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Recommended Updates

1. Update `.agents/core/archetypes/...`
2. Update `skills/.../SKILL.md`
3. Update `.agents/core/standards/...`

## Not a Standards Gap

- Items that belong to the project itself.
- Items that belong to CI/CD repos.
- Items that belong to deployment/infrastructure repos.
```

Every table row needs a gap type from the list above and real evidence
(quote or close paraphrase), not a vague restatement. Every item under
"Recommended Updates" must trace back to at least one table row.
`not-agent-standards` findings go under "Not a Standards Gap", never in the
table.

## Required Final Output: Agent Run Report

Every run of this skill must end with the Standards Gap Audit output above,
followed by:

### Agent Run Report

- Skill:
- Project type/archetype:
- Confidence: high / medium / low
- Inputs used:
- Applicable standards used: standards consulted to classify gaps (e.g.
  `.agents/core/standards/ci-cd.md` for boundary calls)
- Missing inputs:
- Assumptions made:
- Project documentation gaps:
- Standards gaps: only true `core-standard-gap`/`archetype-gap` findings,
  not project or CI/CD items
- Recommended updates to `agent-standards`:
- Items that belong to other repositories: project/CI/CD/infra ownership,
  kept separate from agent-standard ownership
- Follow-up questions, if any:

## Safety constraints

Read-only analysis. Do not modify `skills/`, `.agents/core/`, or
`.agents/core/archetypes/` unless explicitly asked to apply the fix as a follow-up.
Check `.agents/core/standards/ci-cd.md` before labeling anything
`ci-cd-boundary-gap` or `not-agent-standards`. Never invent a gap to pad the
report — if evidence is thin, say so and lower the priority instead.
