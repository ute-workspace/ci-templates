# Rollback Plan

> Canonical portable skill (agent-neutral). Adapter copies: `adapters/claude/.claude/skills/rollback-plan/SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex/skills/rollback-plan/SKILL.md` — keep in sync with this file. See `docs/portable-skills.md`.

Canonical procedure: `.agents/core/sdlc/rollback-plan.md`. Read it before running
this skill.

## Goal

Produce a practical, operationally clear rollback plan.

## Inputs

Change summary, affected systems, current backup/snapshot posture.

## Process

1. Read `.agents/core/sdlc/rollback-plan.md`.
2. Write each required section (see below) grounded in what the project
   actually has (backup tooling, deployment mechanism, data stores).
3. Prefer operational clarity over theory — concrete commands/steps over
   generic advice.
4. Apply `.agents/core/standards/release-versioning.md`'s rollback/hotfix
   expectations (patch/hotfix versioning, tagging) when the plan involves
   a release or hotfix.

## Required outputs

Change summary, affected systems, pre-change backup/snapshot requirements,
rollback trigger conditions, step-by-step rollback, data/state
considerations, verification after rollback, communication notes, risks and
limitations.

## Safety constraints

This skill produces a plan — it does not execute a rollback, backup, or
restore. Rollback execution belongs to deployment tooling
(`ansible`/`automation`/`infra`/`gitops`, or the owning
CI/CD pipeline), not to this skill. Do not execute a production rollback
unless the user explicitly instructs it for this specific change and safe
tooling exists (dry-run support, a tested rollback command, non-production
target) — see `.agents/core/standards/ci-cd.md`. Never read, print, or commit
secrets.
