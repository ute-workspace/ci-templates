# Rules — Angular Library

## Public API boundary

- `public-api.ts` is the entire contract with consumers — export only what's
  intentionally public. Never widen it as a side effect of an internal
  refactor.
- Anything not exported from `public-api.ts` can be renamed, moved, or
  deleted without a breaking-change bump. Treat that boundary as load-bearing.
- Consumers must never be expected to deep-import from `src/lib/...` paths.

## Semantic versioning

- Patch: bug fixes, no API change.
- Minor: new exports/options, backward-compatible.
- Major: any removal or incompatible change to something in
  `public-api.ts` (including changed input/output signatures on exported
  components/directives).
- Deprecate before removing where practical — mark with `@deprecated` and a
  migration note at least one minor version ahead of removal.

## Peer dependencies

- Angular packages (`@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, etc.) are
  `peerDependencies`, not `dependencies` — the library must not bundle or
  pin its own copy of Angular.
- Keep the peer range as wide as realistically supported; don't pin to a
  single exact Angular version unless there's a real compatibility reason.

## Build/package validation

- Build with `ng-packagr` (or equivalent) before every publish, not just
  `ng build` of the demo app.
- Inspect the packaged output (`npm pack --dry-run` or install the tarball
  into the demo app) before publishing — a library that builds in the
  workspace can still produce a broken package (missing files, wrong entry
  points).

## Internationalization (i18n)

- If the library ships UI (components, directives with templates), it
  must not hardcode user-facing text — expose translation inputs
  (`@Input()` text/label bindings, content projection, or i18n tokens the
  consumer supplies) rather than baking a fixed-language string into the
  library, per `core/archetypes/angular-app/rules.md`'s i18n rule, which
  every consumer app is expected to follow.

## Demo/sandbox app

- If the library has any UI surface, maintain a demo app that imports it the
  same way an external consumer would (via the package entry point, not a
  relative path into `src/lib/`).

## Documentation

- Keep README usage snippets in sync with the actual public API — a stale
  example that no longer compiles is worse than no example.

These are recommendations and checks for this archetype, not mandates. An
existing project that already works differently is not required to
restructure to match.
