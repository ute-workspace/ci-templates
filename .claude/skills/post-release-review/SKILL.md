# Post-Release Review

> Canonical portable skill (agent-neutral). Adapter copies: `adapters/claude/.claude/skills/post-release-review/SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex/skills/post-release-review/SKILL.md` — keep in sync with this file. See `docs/portable-skills.md`.

Canonical procedure: `.agents/core/sdlc/post-release-review.md`. Read it before
running this skill.

## Goal

Capture what actually happened after a release and convert lessons into
concrete follow-ups, feeding back into `feature-plan`.

## Inputs

Feature folder(s) covered by the release, PR summary/release notes, CI/CD
logs, monitoring/alerts/incident reports, `release-readiness` output if
it exists.

## Process

1. Read `.agents/core/sdlc/post-release-review.md`.
2. Compare planned scope vs. what shipped.
3. Check monitoring/incident reports for the release window.
4. Note what went well and what failed, with specifics.
5. Turn each issue into a concrete follow-up task.
6. Propose (don't make) any standards updates.

## Required outputs

Release summary, what went well, what failed or was risky, follow-up tasks,
documentation updates needed, proposed standards updates if any.

## Safety constraints

No code, infrastructure, or deployment changes. No direct edits to adapter
skills/rules or `.agents/core/` — propose changes only. Never read, print, or commit
secrets from incident logs/support tickets.
