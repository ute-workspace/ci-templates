description: Create a compatible feature folder from an idea, change request, bug, refactor, documentation task, infrastructure task, or CI/CD task. Use before implementation when work needs planning, requirements, acceptance criteria, risks, and documentation impact.

# Feature Plan

> Canonical portable skill (agent-neutral). Adapter copies: `adapters/claude/.claude/skills/feature-plan/SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex/skills/feature-plan/SKILL.md` — keep in sync with this file. See `docs/portable-skills.md`.

Canonical procedure: `.agents/core/sdlc/feature-planning.md`. Read it before running
this skill.

## Goal

Create or update a feature folder under `features/` from an idea/task/bug,
before implementation.

## Inputs

User idea/request, existing docs, existing code conventions, existing
feature folders.

## Process

1. Read `.agents/core/sdlc/feature-planning.md` in full.
2. Read project `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` and relevant `docs/*.md`.
3. Inspect existing feature folders to follow naming/format.
4. Identify which `.agents/core/standards/*` files the proposed feature touches
   before drafting `implementation-plan.md` — e.g. config changes ->
   `.agents/core/standards/configuration.md`, auth/permissions ->
   `.agents/core/standards/security.md`, external API integration ->
   `.agents/core/standards/api-integration.md` (see other files in
   `.agents/core/standards/` for further matches: `ci-cd.md`, `testing.md`,
   `observability.md`, `release-versioning.md`, etc.). List the
   applicable standards in `implementation-plan.md` and let them shape
   the plan.
5. Write the six documents below using the starter shapes bundled with this
   skill in its own `templates/` directory (installed alongside
   `SKILL.md` — no separate opt-in step).
6. Run the embedded scope-split check (`skills/scope-split/SKILL.md`,
   `.agents/core/sdlc/scope-split.md`): list anything noticed during steps 1-5
   that this feature's acceptance criteria do not require, ask the user
   which of those items to spin off into their own `features/FXXX-.../`
   folders, and create folders only for confirmed items. Never let this
   change the scope, requirements, or acceptance criteria of the feature
   being planned right now.
7. Mark assumptions and open questions explicitly. No code changes.

## Required outputs

```text
features/FXXX-short-name/
  feature.md
  requirements.md
  acceptance-criteria.md
  implementation-plan.md
  risks.md
  docs-impact.md
```

## Safety constraints

No code changes, no deployment actions, no secrets. Ask questions only if
implementation would be unsafe or materially ambiguous.

- `templates/` (this skill's own directory) — starter document shapes,
  installed automatically with this skill, same as any other skill file
- `.agents/core/standards/` — check for the specific standards implicated by the
  feature (e.g. `configuration.md`, `security.md`, `api-integration.md`,
  `ci-cd.md`, `testing.md`, `observability.md`, `release-versioning.md`)
- `skills/scope-split/SKILL.md` — the embedded out-of-scope check run as
  step 6 above
